            <img src="Pic.jpg" alt="My_Pic">
            <p>Hello! My interest in coding stemmed from my enjoyment of creating useful products and my belief that it's similar to solving problems. I've gained a lot of knowledge about coding and computers, and I'm constantly eager to learn more. Apart from coding, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, collaborating with other developers, and lending a hand with open-source projects. I have a strong interest in creating sophisticated answers to challenging issues and am a dedicated software developer. I like to work with other developers, explore new technologies, and contribute to open-source projects when I'm not developing.</p>
